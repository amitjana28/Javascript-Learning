Javascript is a dynamically typed scripting language or we can say that it is a light weight programming language that can be run on browser i.e, client side and when javascript is combined 
with c++ language it is called as node which is used for backend creation which is help is server side programming.

HTML is used for structure of a webpage whereas CSS for styling and Javascript for Behaviour.

Initially it is known as MOcha, livescript and then it is called as javascript.

To run a JS code in browser then browser should have JS Engine in it. JS engine is helps to convert JS code to machine understandable code.

Javascript can be run on browser as well as IDE.
- for browser on inspect tool and open console the right JS script and then run
- for VS code we can write code and run using nodeJS. Also we can open terminal go to correct directory and write "node fileName.js" and hit enter

How we can add JS in HTML?
- Inline scripting : Using Script tag, we can add script tag inside head tag and body tag either opening if body tag or closing of body tag. Best practise is to
add in end of body tag
- External Scripting : We can create a js file ad write our code and pass that inside script tag using src attribute

Variables : It is a names memory locations such as var age = 25; or const name = "Amit jana" or let rollNo = 251802108;
- var : It is used to create variables in JS it is function scope and globally scoped not blocked scoped and it can be redefined and reassigned.
- let : It is used to create variable and it is blocked scoped can be redefined and reassigned.
- const : It is used to create constant variable that can't be changed. But const object like arrays can be changed.

Variable naming convesions rule are:
- it can start with number, underscore or sign or symbole like doller
- no space between names and follow camelCase only. Ex : let ageOfStudents
- variable name should be meaningfull and reserved keyword can't be used as name.

Datatypes in Javascript :  Primitive and non premitive Datatypes

Primitive data types :
- BigInt : when we have to write a number that is greater then or less then -2 to the power 53 -1 to  + 2^53-1
- number : integer, decimal
- Strings : characters or sentance or word
- null : 
- undefined : when we declare and variable but not define its value then its undefined such as let name; and we try to print name it should be undefined
- boolean : true or false
- symbols : 

typeof(variableName) : it is used to check the Datatypes of a variable.
